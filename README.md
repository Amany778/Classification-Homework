# Credit Risk Evaluation
  These two notebooks will build and evaluate several machine learning models to predict credit risk using data one would typically see from peer-to-peer lending services. Credit risk is an inherently imbalanced classification problem (the number of good loans is much larger than the number of at-risk loans), so we will employ different techniques for training and evaluating models with imbalanced classes. We will use the imbalanced-learn and Scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using the two following techniques:


## Files
Resampling Starter Notebook
Ensemble Starter Notebook
Lending Club Loans Data
LoanStats_2019Q1.csv


## Resampling
 We use the imbalanced learn library to resample the LendingClub data and build and evaluate logistic regression classifiers using the resampled data.
### The following questions are answered:
  Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
  Which model had the best recall score?
  Which model had the best geometric mean score?


## Ensemble Learning
In this section, we will train and compare two different ensemble classifiers to predict loan risk and evaluate each model. We will use the Balanced Random Forest Classifier and the Easy Ensemble Classifier. 
### The following questions are answered:
  Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?
  Which model had the best recall score?
  Which model had the best geometric mean score?
  What are the top three features?
